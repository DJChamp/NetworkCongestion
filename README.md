# NetworkCongestion

Network Congestion: Network congestion is the situation in which an increase
in data transmissions results in a proportionately smaller increase, or even a
reduction, in throughput. Throughput is the amount of data that passes through
the network per unit of time, such as the number of packets per second.
Control Methods:
Network bottlenecks, which are the main reasons of congestion in a
network, must be eliminated. Just like a traffic jam caused by a narrowing of a
busy four-lane highway to just two lanes, a bottleneck, which is a network’s
segment unable to handle the amount of traffic coming from its connecting
segments, causes intolerable amounts of congestion on a network. Bottlenecks
can be eliminated by increasing the segment’s bandwidth capacity so it
matches the neighboring segments’ maximum traffic flow. This can be
accomplished by upgrading this network’s segment or using different one.
TCP/IP protocol settings must be optimized to improve the connection
between nodes in your network. You can use TCP tuning techniques to adjust
the network congestion avoidance parameters of TCP connections over high-
bandwidth, high-latency networks. Sometimes, properly tuned networks can
perform up to 5 times better. However, be aware that blindly following
instructions without understanding their real consequences can worst the
performance as well.
